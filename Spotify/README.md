## 3. Dataset
The dataset has been obtained from the Spotify Global Music Dataset (2009–2025) dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/spotify-global-music-dataset-20092025/code?datasetId=8708707&sortBy=voteCount)

The dataset has 8778 rows and 15 dimensions, where some of the most important of these dimensions are: 


## 4. Business Questions / Objectives
- How do the different characteristics of each genre differ from each other?


## 5. Methodology / Approach
- Data cleaning steps

- Exploratory data analysis

- Statistical methods

- Tools (Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, PowerBI, SQL, etc.)


## 6. Results & Insights

Summaries of key findings:

- Visuals

- Metrics

- Insights

- Recommendations

Example:

- Customers with high monthly charges have 3× higher churn.

- Senior citizens churn 20% more frequently.

- Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn.


## 7. Installation & Setup
Steps to run the project locally:
- git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
- cd ~/Documents/Projects/Personal-Projects/Spotify
- python3 -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- code .


## 8. Technologies Used
List:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code


## 9. Limitations & Future Work
After carrying out the exploratory analysis, I've identified the following limitations and next steps:
- Dataset is small and may not generalize.
- The model could be improved with feature engineering.
- Time-series structure was not used.
